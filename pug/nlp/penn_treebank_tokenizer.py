"""
Penn Treebank tokenizer, adapted from `nltk.tokenize.treebank.py`, which 
in turn is adapted from an infamous sed script by Robert McIntyre. Even 
ignoring the reduced import overhead, this is about half again faster than 
the NLTK version; don't ask me why.
>>> s = '''Good muffins cost $3.88\\nin New York.  Please buy me\\ntwo of them.\\nThanks.'''
>>> word_tokenize(s)
['Good', 'muffins', 'cost', '$', '3.88', 'in', 'New', 'York.', 'Please', 'buy', 'me', 'two', 'of', 'them.', 'Thanks', '.']
>>> s = "They'll save and invest more."
>>> word_tokenize(s)
['They', "'ll", 'save', 'and', 'invest', 'more', '.']
